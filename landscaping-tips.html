      <ul class="p-5">
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Plan before you buy.</strong> Sketch your landscape design on
          paper before you start planting and building. Knowing exactly what you
          need and where you're going to put it helps avoid wasting money.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Decide how much design you want.</strong> Although it's less
          expensive to build a square patio or deck, it's no bargain if you find
          the result so unappealing that you don't use it. It may be worth it to
          pay a designer to create a space that you can really use.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Buy in phases.</strong> Few people have the financial
          resources to landscape their property all at once. Divide your project
          into phases, and pay as you go with funds on hand. You'll save on loan
          or credit costs and be able to evaluate your progress and adjust plans
          before moving to the next phase.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Don't assume cheaper is always better.</strong> Economics of
          scale being what they are, home improvement warehouses typically offer
          the lowest prices for common plants and hardscaping materials, such as
          lumber. However, they may not have the selection and quality you find
          at more specialized sources. Also, a local specialty shop may provide
          more personal service, expert advice, and guarantees, which are all
          helpful if you're a novice. When installing a pond, for example, it
          may be worth it to pay more through a source that specializes in water
          gardens, particularly if the staff can help you choose and install
          equipment. Plant prices may be higher at specialty nurseries, but many
          offer money-back guarantees on trees, shrubs, and bedding plants.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Accept cheaper when it's good enough.</strong> With some
          items, there's little difference in quality between top-of-the-line
          and economy. Why pay more? Take advantage of a home improvement
          warehouse's volume buying power for bargains on common annualsand
          perennials, mulch, pavers, and containers. Inspect plants closely,
          however. A "big box" store may not care for them the way a nursery
          would.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Time your purchases.</strong> When you buy can be as important
          as where you buy. Lumber foroutdoor projects is often cheaper during
          winter months. Save money on trees, shrubs, perennials, soil, and
          mulch by buying late in the season. Don't rush out to buy newly
          released plant varieties, which may be expensive initially because
          supply is low and demand is high. When production catches up in a few
          years, prices will likely drop.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Shop online and mail-order sources.</strong> Catalogs and
          websites expand your choices, especially for rare plants and
          specialized products. Shopping online or by phone is convenient, and
          prices may be lower than in stores, but don't forget to include
          shipping costs when comparing prices with local sources.

        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Check alternate resources.</strong> Look beyond stores and
          catalogs for bargains. Arboretums and botanical centers often hold
          plant sales, and neighbors may have extra perennials to share. Some
          cities offer free mulch and compost, and construction and demolition
          sites can be sources of bricks and stones.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-5">
          <strong>Be sociable.</strong> Being neighborly cuts costs. Share the
          rental fee for tillers, chippers, or other heavy equipment with others
          on the block, then take turns and save.

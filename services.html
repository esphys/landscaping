          <p>
            Could your current landscaping use some work? We provide services
            for the maintenance of your current landscaping. These services
            include, but are not limited to, fertilization, tree trimming,
            irrigation, aeration and clean up. We have the resources to
            effectively custom design and implement your landscape. We work with
            private home owners, apartment complexes, parks, schools, hospitals
            and commercial developments to create landscapes that are
            functional, safe and aesthetically pleasing.

          <p class="lead">Edging</p>
          <p>
            It's the finishing touch of mowing, kind of like getting a shave
            after you've had a haircut. An edger is used to trim the lawn along
            a hard surface like a driveway or sidewalk. They cut a nice clean
            edge. This is included with our lawn service.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">Fertilizer</p>
          <p>
            Most soils are not able to provide all nutrients needed for your
            grass to develop thick, green, and weed free. We fertilize grass in
            order to promote leaf and root growth, aid in recovery from foot
            traffic and pest damage. It also reduces and helps control weeds.
            There are 2 types of fertilizer liquid and granular fertilizers we
            apply either one depending on customer consent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">Weed Control</p>
          <p>
            Lawn weeds such as crabgrass and dandelions pose one of the most
            persistent and annoying challenges in the great American quest to
            grow decent grass. The fertilizer we apply to your lawn is a
            combination of both fertilizer and weed control. As nutrients are
            released, the root system of your grass fills in any bare patches,
            this in itself promotes lawn weed control, depriving weed seeds of a
            place to germinate. Thus creating a beautiful, thick, green lawn.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">Aerating</p>
          <p>
            Even with the best care available, lawns can thin out and lose color
            due to excessive thatch buildup, too much foot traffic or pet
            traffic through specific areas that create hard or compacted soils,
            or periods of high temperature, high humidity, or drought. Aerating
            and overseeing is recognized by turf experts such as golf course
            superintendents as the best treatment to control thatch, helps
            reduce those compacted areas, fills in bare spots and revitalize
            growth An aeration treatment removes small cores of soil and thatch
            to allow air, moisture and nutrients to penetrate down to the root
            zone. The cores brought to the surface contain microorganisms, which
            help the breakdown of the woody thatch tissue layer just below the
            lawn's crown. As the thatch layer is broken down, it is converted
            into organic matter that will then combine with existing soil
            particles. Also, as the cores begin to breakdown over a period of
            several weeks, the holes gradually fill in with a mixture of organic
            matter and soil, and the filled hole allows roots of existing grass
            plants to spread out and grow deeper, creating a healthier, thicker
            lawn.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">De-Thatch</p>
          <p>
            Thatch is the built-up of plant material between green growth and
            the grass roots, is essential, but too much can deter healthy lawn
            growth. The best time to dethatch your lawn is just before your
            lawn's most vigorous growth cycle. The best time to dethatch is a
            cool season lawn is late August to Early October depending on your
            area. During this time the grass is growing vigorously and should
            recover quickly. Dethatching in the fall is also recommended because
            at this time the weed seeds are not germinating so that your grass
            does not have to compete with them.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p class="lead">Mulch</p>
          <p>
            Mulch is any type of material that is spread or laid over the
            surface of the soil as a covering. It is used to retain moisture in
            the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool and make the garden bed
            look more attractive. Organic mulches also help improve the soil’s
            fertility, as they decompose. Wood chips are a very popular mulch
            because of its neat appearance, as well as its hardiness. We carry
            mulch in Brick Red, Cedar Color, Chestnut, Walnut (Dark Brown), Beer
            Nuts and even New York Jets Black.

          <p class="lead">Sod</p>
          <p>
            To start new lawns, or even repair damaged lawns, many people wonder
            which is better: laying sod or sowing grass seed. While seeding is
            cheaper and offers a wider variety of grass types, many people are
            won over to laying sod. Laying sod is fast and produces high-quality
            new lawns. In fact, laying sod is so fast, it's fair to say it gives
            you an "instant lawn".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">Over Seeding</p>
          <p>
            Over seeding is an overlooked activity in American home lawn care.
            Gardeners assume that fertilizer is all that is needed to keep a
            turf thick and free of weeds. Grass gets tired. It needs to be
            revitalized every few years. Over seeding is one of the most
            important lawn care tasks, yet few homeowners ever do it. Over
            seeding compensates for that natural slow down of the turf's
            reproduction. There are two major benefits to over seeding every
            three or four years. First, you insure your lawn stays thick and
            dense, or if it has thinned, you will make it thick again. Thick
            grass has few if any weeds if it is mowed over 2 inches tall. The
            second benefit is disease resistance. The new varieties of seed you
            sow this year will have better disease resistance than those
            varieties already in your lawn.

          <p class="lead">Grub Control</p>
          <p>
            One such pest actually eats the roots of grass. This pest is quite
            common and can appear anywhere in the United States. Grubs are the
            larval stage of beetles. There are many types of grubs but the ones
            which live in the dirt under grass are most likely Japanese Beetle,
            June Beetle, May Beetle, Black Turfgrass, Asiatic Garden or some
            other regional beetle which lays eggs whose larvae feed on plants
            Grubs can vary greatly in size Grubs live just under grass, usually
            6 inches to a few feet down. Such results will include dead grass,
            plants and flowers their presence tends to attract all kinds of
            animals. Moles, armadillo, badgers, birds, mice, rats, voles,
            shrews, gophers, groundhogs, muskrat, opossum, raccoon, prairie
            dogs, and skunk and snuffaluffagus are just some of the animals
            which will readily tear up and pull apart lawns in an effort to find
            grubs. Grub control will eliminate any potential problems and
            eliminate all the grubs.

          <p>
            We come to your home and comb through your property for any dog
            waste or pet waste. Since stools are usually solid, owners have the
            option of frequent manual removal. With more time for the nitrogen
            waste to dissolve into the lawn, stools that are frequently removed,
            damage lawns less than urine.

          <p>
            Drain tile systems serve two purposes. Water removal away from the
            house and water injection into the soil foundation during drought.
            Drought conditions can cause the soil of your foundation to shrink,
            causing foundation and footer to fall. We come to you’re home
            evaluate where drain tile is needed and how to pull water away from
            the wet areas.
